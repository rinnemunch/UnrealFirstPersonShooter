# First Person Target Practice ðŸŽ¯

![Gameplay Win Demo](images/Animation.gif)

This is my first larger Unreal Engine 5.5 project. A timed first-person shooting challenge where the goal is to destroy seven destructible targets before the clock hits zero. The rifle includes muzzle flash particle effects when firing, and each target crumbles apart using destructible geometry for visual feedback.

I followed along with the excellent Unreal Sensei YouTube tutorial to learn the core setup and Blueprint logic, then added my own touches to finish the project. Excited to keep improving my Unreal skills and build more polished projects in the future.
